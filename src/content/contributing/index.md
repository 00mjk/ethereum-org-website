### Content contributions

As mentioned in [ethereum.org's core principles](#core-principles), the goal is for ethereum.org to serve as a portal to resources created by the community. We strive to direct people to community-built resources vs. replace them. While we trend towards minimal native-content, we have received feedback from the community that it's valuable for us to have some.

When proposing a new page or updating an existing page, keep in mind the goal is not to be a comprehensive encyclopedia of Ethereum but rather to be a stepping stone for someoneâ€™s journey into Ethereum. Each page should provide a story: e.g. introducing a topic, answering a question & providing next steps for the visitor to learm more or take a particular action.

#### Notes on specific kinds of contributions

When proposing new items to Ethereum.org we ask contributors to add their new addition(s) to the bottom of each section/list. This helps keep things fair for all contributors. In the future, we may consider adding a ranking system for the sections but for now this is the practice we are employing.

#### I want to add a developer tool or project

Developer tool submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

- Is it meaningfully differentiated from tools already listed?
  - New categories or types of tools
  - New features compared to existing similar tools
  - Targeted at a distinct use-case not covered by existing similar tools
- Is the tool well documented?
  - Does documentation exist?
  - Is it sufficient to use the tool?
  - Has it been recently updated?
- Is the tool widely used?
  - We will consider metrics such as GitHub stars, download statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects
- Is the tool of sufficient quality?
  - Are there recurring bugs?
  - Is the tool reliable?

#### I want to add an educational article or resource

Learning resources will be assessed by the following criteria:

- Is the content up to date?
- Is the information accurate? Is it factual or opinion-based?
- Is the author credible? Do they reference their sources?
- Does this content add distinct value that existing resources/links don't cover?
- Which [user persona](https://www.notion.so/efdn/Ethereum-org-User-Persona-Memo-b44dc1e89152457a87ba872b0dfa366c) does this content serve?

#### I want to add an Ethereum-based application

Dapp submissions will be assessed on the following criteria:

- Is the dapp a "user" application? This page is targeted at a new user, which means it wouldn't be appropriate to list a dev tool or app targeted at sophisticated technical users.
- Does the application have a good user on-boarding process, such that a user can follow the link, and find all the instructions they need to get started?
- Does the application "round out" the list by adding a new kind of application not already present?
- Is there evidence that the application is popular and well established?
