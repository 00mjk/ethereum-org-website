PIVOT: $EORG â†’ Testnet wallet

- B) Guided testnet experience?
    - Wallet signup flow
        - [https://www.figma.com/file/5CFYpOcdM3dqTtsnSe3jcw/Homepage-v2?node-id=34%3A221](https://www.figma.com/file/5CFYpOcdM3dqTtsnSe3jcw/Homepage-v2?node-id=34%3A221)
        - Can we demonstrate "access to dapps" via wallet? that it can be used as an ID of sorts?
            - Just show? By displaying a Blockie & explaining it could be used?
            - Or actually integrate some testnet dapp? Where each address can vote once?
                - It would be nice to demonstrate signing a transaction...
        - Should we explain how it works?
            - Should we explain private key? How that's the "password" to this account & whoever has access can control the address?
    - Open questions
        - How to get testnet ETH for user?
            - Can we create our own faucet? Or would we have to regularly top up & send wallets ETH from our account?
            - Who to ask? EF discord?
            - Should we run our own Ganache/Buidler EVM network?
            - Do we instead create a testnet token to send the user?

    Level 1: create a wallet & receive ETH/token

    Level 2: create a transaction

    DRAFT PR FLOW:

    - Create wallet
    - Receive token
    - Token swap / NFT buy
        - Buy a pixel on ethereum.org?
            - a la [http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/)
        - The fuller the page the more the pixel cost?
        - Shows that you can own percentages of things and have a stake in their success

    TO FIGURE OUT: 

    - Wallet is access to a dapp
    -
